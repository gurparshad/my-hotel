## Improvements

Important improvement - currently if i want to share my chosen the hotel room with someone I can't do it. It should have this functionality.

A potential improvement could be to use the immer library for updating nested state more concisely. This library, integrated into Redux Toolkit, allows you to write code that "mutates" state in a more natural way.
